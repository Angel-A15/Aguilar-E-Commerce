E-commerce Company Development

## Description
My client is a manager from a internet retail company and requests to establish the back end development for their website.
This would give their company to compete with other e-commerce copanies.

Their standards for the back end are;
  * After entering database name, MySQL(name & password), the user will connect to the database using Sequalize
  * Entering schema and seed commands will develop a database and is seeded with test data
  * Invoking the application would sync the Sequalize models to the MySQL database
  * Data for API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, prodcuts, or tags is displayed in JSON format
  * Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia will be able to alter data in the database
