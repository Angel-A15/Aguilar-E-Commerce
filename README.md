E-commerce Company Development

## Description
My client is a manager from a internet retail company and requests to establish the back end development for their website.
This would give their company to compete with other e-commerce copanies.

Their standards for the back end are;
  * After entering database name, MySQL(name & password), the user will connect to the database using Sequalize
  * Entering schema and seed commands will develop a database and is seeded with test data
  * Invoking the application would sync the Sequalize models to the MySQL database
  * Data for API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, prodcuts, or tags is displayed in JSON format
  * Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia will be able to alter data in the database
  * When being tested in Insomnia, routes should be able to demonstrate the actions of GET requests for a single variable or all variables, and show the use of POST,PUT, DELETE routes for variables

## Project
To meet my clients demands, I constructed the back-end code for the application by add the following:
 * Creating databases and tables in the models folder into sequalize syntax that make it easy for a user to understand in
 * Created GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT routes that maniupalte the data to display later in Insomnia for testing
 * Set the data tables up with keys to refer to one another when requesting data from other table
 * Executed association methods to create relationships between the tables
